This is an updated analysis of **Anderson et al. JAM manuscript ("Rumen bacterial communities can be acclimated faster to high concentrate diets than currently implemented feedlot programs"**). The outputs generated through this analysis are identical to those of the original analysis (viwed at <insert>). Updated analysis was conducted to mostly attempt better coding and reproducible research practices.

The R Markdown file in this repository contains the code for the analysis. To reproduce the analysis, you simply need to is donwload the run.sh file (wget type ./run.sh. There will be prompts at first as Anaconda package manager is installed. They are straightforward, **except when prompted for a location to install type *anaconda*.

The analysis is setup to run on a Mac OS X environment, but can be easily switched to run in linux by uncommenting/commenting the appropriate lines in run.sh for anaconda installation.
