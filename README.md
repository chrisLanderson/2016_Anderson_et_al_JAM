This is an updated analysis of **Anderson et al. JAM manuscript ("Rumen bacterial communities can be acclimated faster to high concentrate diets than currently implemented feedlot programs"**). The outputs generated through this analysis are identical to those of the original analysis (https://github.com/chrisLanderson/old_Anderson_et_al_JAM_Acclimation). Updated analysis was conducted to mostly attempt better coding and reproducible research practices.

The R Markdown file in this repository contains the code for the analysis. To reproduce the analysis, you simply need to is **download the run.sh file (wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisLanderson/2016_Anderson_et_al_JAM/master/run.sh) and type run.sh**.

The analysis is setup to run on a Mac OS X environment, but can be easily switched to run in linux by uncommenting/commenting the appropriate lines in run.sh for anaconda installation.
